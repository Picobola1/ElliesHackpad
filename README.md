My insparation to make this was for a friend who loves to play friday night funkin using WASD, and i havent seen her in a while so i though this could be a cool gift.

# BOM:
- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x SK6812 MINI LED
- 1x PCB

  the hardest part about this was my time constraint, the highway end july 31 and i would be a at a over night camp monday through friday that week.... i started this project july 25 lol. i had just about 2 days.

  3d printed parts color: red, keycaps: blue
